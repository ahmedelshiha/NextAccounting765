# Client Portal Upgrade Plan (UAE • KSA • Egypt)

A comprehensive, phased implementation plan to upgrade the client portal for a multi-country tax platform. The plan aligns features visible in the reference UI with the needs of a tax-filing product and adapts them to regulatory requirements of UAE, KSA, and Egypt.

---

## 1) Snapshot: What the reference UI conveys and how it maps to a tax portal

Key elements observed in the provided screenshot and recommended mapping:

- Left sidebar menu (Messaging, Current Account, Payment Gateway, Corporate Cards, Connected Banking, Trademark, Documents)
  - Messaging → Secure in-portal conversations, cases, and task threads per filing period.
  - Current Account / Connected Banking → Bank feeds for reconciliation and cash/expense evidence supporting returns (read-only). Regional support for local banks.
  - Payment Gateway → Client invoices, online payments for firm fees; links to government payment references (FTA/ZATCA/ETA portals) when applicable.
  - Corporate Cards → Receipts inbox; OCR to tag VAT or deductible categories; optional.
  - Trademark → Replace with “Registrations & Certificates” (TRN, ZATCA e-invoice device IDs, ETA profile, ESR submissions, commercial registration documents).
  - Documents → Source-of-truth document vault with folders by Entity→Year→Tax Type.

- Top navigation (Dashboard, Accounts, Updates, Teams, AI Agents, Billing, Support)
  - Dashboard → Filing calendar, upcoming/overdue actionables, return status widgets.
  - Accounts → Entities & People; client teams and permissions.
  - Updates → Compliance alerts (rate changes, schema changes like ZATCA Phase-2, ETA updates), and product release notes.
  - Teams → Client-side user management (owners, finance, auditor access). 
  - AI Agents → Assisted intake, doc classification, compliance Q&A, checklist generation.
  - Billing → Firm billing and client invoices, payment methods, credit balance.
  - Support → Knowledge base, tickets, SLA status, live chat.

- Center content (Entities/People tabs, empty state, search, new buttons)
  - Entities ↔ client companies; People ↔ individual taxpayers and authorized users.
  - Deep search across entities, returns, invoices, docs.
  - “+” actions to add Entity/Person; smart templates by country.

- Right panel (Business Actionables → Upcoming/Renewals)
  - Filing deadlines and renewals: VAT returns, Corporate Tax, Zakat (KSA), ESR (UAE), Withholding Tax (KSA), E-invoice device renewals (KSA), activity renewals (Egypt: e-invoicing profile/ETA obligations).

- Other elements: Dark theme, notifications, quick sign out, privacy badge, chat bubble
  - Maintain dark theme with accessible color contrast. Notifications unify portal, email, and WhatsApp/SMS (opt-in).

---

## 2) Product Goals

- Single portal for clients across UAE, KSA, Egypt to manage tax obligations, returns, payments, and compliance artifacts.
- Reduce back-and-forth via messaging, structured tasks, and automated intake.
- Provide audit-ready, immutable records (docs, approvals, timelines).
- Minimize regional friction with country-specific automations and checklists.

---

## 3) Regulatory Landscape (country highlights)

- UAE
  - VAT (FTA): 5% VAT returns, refund claims, voluntary disclosures, ESR notifications/reports, Corporate Tax (9% effective now) returns.
  - TRN validation, FTA e-Services flows (link-out for payment/submission with tracked references).
- KSA
  - ZATCA VAT (15%), Zakat (for certain entities), Withholding Tax, e-Invoicing (Phase-2, integration compliance: reporting/clearance, device and CSR/CRT management), e-archiving requirements.
- Egypt
  - ETA VAT and e-Invoicing clearance, e-Receipt for B2C, withholding/stamp where applicable; identity and certificate management.

Implications: separate templates, calendars, validations, and evidentiary document sets per country; configurable per entity.

---

## 4) Information Architecture

- Tenancy
  - Tenant = client group; Entity = legal company or individual taxpayer; People = users or directors; Advisors = firm users.
- Primary Objects
  - Entity profiles: country, registrations (TRN/ZATCA/ETA), activity, fiscal calendar.
  - Filing cycles: VAT, Corporate Tax, Zakat, ESR, WHT, e-Invoice obligations.
  - Documents: categories (invoices, bank statements, contracts, payroll, fixed assets, tax adjustments), retention rules.
  - Tasks & checklists: per filing period, per obligation.
  - Payments & invoices: firm invoices, official references, reconciliation.
  - Messages & tickets: case threads tied to returns and tasks.
  - Banking connections: read-only transactions, statement fetch, receipts OCR pipeline.
  - Notifications: digest, deadline alerts, missing-evidence reminders.
